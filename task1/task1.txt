What we did:

Jelle van Cappelle:
Made general purpose register (which will be used for register_A and register_B) and its test bench.
General purpose register was made using SR-flipflops, using the inputs of the register and some additional logic to control the flipflops, and by mapping the outputs of the flipflops to the output of the register.

Léon van Velzen:
Made MUX1_2to1 and MUX4_2to1 ...

How to simulate:
For files in task1/reg/: run the following commands:
	ghdl -a reg.vhd
	ghdl -a reg-tb.vhd
	ghdl -r reg_tb --vcd=reg_test.vcd --stop-time=5000ns
